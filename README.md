# Exponential-Simulation-vs-Central-Limit-Theorem
A simulation of 40000 exponential number with its comparison towards the theoretical properties

This report studies the exponential distribution in R programming. 40 sets of 1000 exponential random numbers are generated and comparison of mean, variance, distribution and qqline are created.
